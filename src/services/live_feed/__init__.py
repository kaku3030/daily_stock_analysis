"""Live Feed Reliability V0.1 -- P0-1 Slice 1 foundation.

Types, boundaries, and a nonblocking single-writer controller skeleton
only. See docs/LIVE_FEED_RELIABILITY_CONTRACT_V0_1.md for the frozen
design and docs/LIVE_FEED_IMPLEMENTATION_SEQUENCE_V0_1.md for what is and
is not implemented yet. No real Futu behavior, no LIVE promotion, no
DecisionEligibility.
